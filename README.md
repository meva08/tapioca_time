# Tapioca Time!

**Description:** 

This final project is a 2D game made in Unity called “Tapioca Time”. You aim to complete as many boba orders as possible to earn money! Youtube Link to game introduction: https://youtu.be/2-vJ2-jRXQA

**How to Play:**

Please unzip the tapioca-time.zip within the tapioca-time folder to access the app. The game app is most compatible with macOS. Double click the exported app, which should have the icon of a boba. 

Refer to the instructions to below for controls and goals!
You play as the player figure in the center of the screen. Player controls for movement are attached to the arrow keys or W, A, S, and D keys to move up, right, down, and left respectively. On the bottom left of the screen, there is a timer that will count down from 120 seconds. In the top right of the screen, there is a text box that says “New Order” with a list of ingredients. Your goal is to complete the order given to you and complete as many orders as you can within the time limit. You will get a letter grade depending on how many orders you complete!  

Towards the top of the screen, there is a series of stations. The cabinet on the far left contains Thai Tea. The next station over is a fridge that contains Whole Milk. After the fridge, there is a sink that dumps out all of the contents of your cup. To the left of the sink, there is another fridge that contains Skim Milk. Finally, after the fridge, there is another cabinet that contains Black Tea. 

There are three more stations at the bottom of the screen. The brown table on the far right has a bucket with a pink boba icon which will give you popping boba when interacted with. The table to the left contains a black boba icon which will give you tapioca boba. Finally, there is a station to the left of the table that has a shaking boba icon which represents the boba-shaking station. Interacting with this station will trigger a mini-game in which you have to rapidly press x. If you press the x button enough (30) times, the order will go through, and if it matches the “current order” box on the top right, your player will gain money (shown on the top left of the screen) and a new order will appear on the top right for you to complete. 

Once the timer reaches 0, if you have completed a sufficient amount of orders, you will win. If you have not completed enough orders, you will lose. There will also be the option to replay the level by pressing “Q” once the game-over screen appears.

**How to Access the Files:**

Please clone this repository to access the files. https://github.com/meva08/tapioca_time

Unity Hub and Unity Editor 2022 3.14 will need to be installed to access the editor screen and see many of the inspector, components, and other details of the game. Within the “assets” folder, click on main.unity to start up the Unity editor. You could also click “add a project” in Unity Hub.
In the “Scenes” folder is “SampleScene”, which is where everything is stored and configured. All scripts, sounds, scenes, and art assets are stored within the “Assets” folder and its various subfolders. Scripts are written in C#, use much of Unity’s syntax, and can be opened in VSCode. The comments should explain the logic of the code within each script.
