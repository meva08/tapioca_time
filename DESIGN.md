# Design

**Overall Design:**
“Tapioca Time” is inspired by Overcooked, except our game is single-player and focuses more on quick reactions and getting familiar with the system.  We wanted to create a cute and lighthearted game within the timeframe!
Art, Sound, and UI Design:
	We used free, public online resources for much of the art and music. Credits below:
